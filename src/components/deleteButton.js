// Your posts should have a way for the active user to delete them, only if isAuthor is true for the post. Go ahead and add that now.

// You'll also have to add a click handler to make that DELETE request. For each post, the delete handler will need a way to recover the post._id to help form the correct URL for the request.

// On successful delete, make sure to remove that post from the page as well as from the array that is holding all posts in state.
