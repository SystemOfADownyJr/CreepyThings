// You should make a form for users to make new listings. The fields for the form should match the fields that the API expects, and the submit button should be intercepted so that you can create the right fetch request.

// This form could live in an aside that you show only to logged in users, or on submit you could show a modal that requires a person to sign in/sign up before you create the post. If you choose to show the form for logged in users only, make sure to update the interface whenever the user logs in... not only on page load.

// The returned object is the new post. Since your state is keeping track of all available posts, it might be wise to add the returned one to that array and set state accordingly when it comes back.
